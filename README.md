##scotch Directory##
This is my new work. It requires that you install Redis first.

You have to run Redis first, then run *node server.js*.

It's probably easier to ask me in person how to run this, rather than typing it.

##keyword-wrangler Directory##
No changes to what we've already seen in Dave's. Still keyword-wrangler.

##Miscellaneous Directory##
Still Miscellaneous.

##experiments Directory##
Still experiments.
