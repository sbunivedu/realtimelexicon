# This is Spencer's branch for RealTimeLexicon.
_Brief explanation:_ Scotch is new, sharescotch is my experimenting everything else is old stuff.

## Scotch
This is my new work.

It requires that you:
- Install Redis first. There are a couple complicated commands.
- Then to run: You have to run Redis first, then run your _node server.js_.

(I recommend asking me in person because it isn't entirely straightforward)

## ShareScotch
This is my experiments directory.

I'm working on making this work with ShareDB.

## Keyword-Wrangler
No changes to Dave's.

## Miscellaneous
Still Miscellaneous.

## Experiments
Still experiments.
